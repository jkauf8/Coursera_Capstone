## Introduction/Business Problem
Intro: I would like to help someone who is looking to open a resturaunt in New York. Using data science I would like to recommend where the best place to open their new resturaunt would be. <br />
Target Audience: This would help those who are looking to open a resturaunt in New York City. <br />
Business Problem: Key factors to look into for when deciding a resturaunt location may include the wealth of the area, crime rate of the area, and proximity to competitors. 



## Data
I will be using data from Foursquare as well as public New York City data. Foursquare data will allow me to researh if there are competitors in the area and public data given by New York City will give me insights on average income and population certain neighborhoods.

### New York Census Data can be found at: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcountymanhattanboroughnewyork,bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork,queenscountyqueensboroughnewyork,kingscountybrooklynboroughnewyork,richmondcountystatenislandboroughnewyork,newyorkcitynewyork/HSG010219


## Methodology
I used 2019 New York City Census data in order to find out if which boroughs in New York had the highest populations and highest incomes. After finding this I explored which borough had the best ratio of income and population to help determine which borough would be the best to open up a new resturaunt in. On top of this, I accessed geo locator data in order to highlight potential areas for resturaunt openings.


## Results
After exploring potential resturaunt destinations and different incomes and populations within different areas of New York City, it seems as though the borough of Kings County may be a good place to open up a new resturaunt with a large population and high income area. The area of Kings County can be seen as highlighted on the map.

## Discussion
When I first began this project, I expected Bronx to be the best destination for opening a new resturaunt however its massive population with lower income to population ratio surprised me. I would recommend opening up a new resturaunt in Kings County in order to be more profitable.

## Conclusion
This report may help those looking to open a new resturaunt in New York City, however who don't know where the most profitable may be. By comparing numerous boroughs within the city of New York City, I am able to provide some insight and guidance on potential profitable locations.
