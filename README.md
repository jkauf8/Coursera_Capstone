## Introduction/Business Problem
Intro: I would like to help someone who is looking to open a resturaunt in New York. Using data science I would like to recommend where the best place to open their new resturaunt would be. <br />
Target Audience: This would help those who are looking to open a resturaunt in New York City. <br />
Business Problem: Key factors to look into for when deciding a resturaunt location may include the wealth of the area, crime rate of the area, and proximity to competitors. 



## Data
I will be using data from Foursquare as well as public New York City data. Foursquare data will allow me to researh if there are competitors in the area and public data given by New York City will give me insights on average income in certain neighborhoods.

### Crime rates data can be found at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page
